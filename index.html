  <h1>greetings, christyn</h1>

  <p>you might be a little confused about what you just opened—and that's totally okay. i get it.</p>

  <p>i made this small page because sometimes, the words i really want to say don't come out the way i want when i'm in front of you.</p>

  <p>so here it is, just written out plainly and honestly, i like you. not just casually, and not as a passing thought. i genuinely like you, christyn.</p>

  <p>and every time i try to brush it off, thinking maybe it’ll go away, it doesn’t. i catch myself thinking about you more than i mean to. and honestly, i don’t want to keep it to myself anymore.</p>

  <p>if you'd be open to it, i’d like the chance to court you. slowly, genuinely, and with nothing but respect for you and your pace.</p>

  <p>thank you for reading this. it means more than you know.</p>
